Here's a sample `README.md` update that describes how to run your script while keeping the input and output directories defined in the code:

---

# Image Inpainting with Keras OCR

This script detects and inpaints text characters in images using Keras OCR.

## Requirements

Ensure you have the following libraries installed:

- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Keras OCR

You can install the required libraries using the `requirements.txt` file:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

To run the script, use the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python script_name.py
```

**Note**: The script is set to read images from a predefined input directory (`input`) and will save the output images to a predefined output directory (`outputTess`). You can modify these directories in the code if needed.

## Input Directory Structure

Make sure you have an `input` directory in the same location as your script, containing the images you want to process. The script supports the following image formats:

- PNG
- JPG
- JPEG

## Output

The processed images will be saved in the `outputTess` directory after running the script.

Feel free to modify any parts of the `README.md` to better suit your project's style!

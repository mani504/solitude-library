# Text Removal and Inpainting for Satellite/Map Images

## Problem Statement
Satellite images and map visuals often contain annotations, labels, and text that may obstruct important underlying details. In scenarios like geographical analysis, urban planning, or automated map processing, this text needs to be removed while preserving the integrity of the surrounding areas.  

Traditional inpainting techniques can handle small irregular regions effectively but fail when applied to structured and larger text-like areas, especially in satellite or map images where the environment demands precision. This project presents a robust pipeline for detecting and removing text, followed by realistic inpainting of the affected areas.

## Why Simple Inpainting Fails for Satellite/Map Images
In traditional inpainting techniques, like those using naive mask generation:
- **Text Detection**: Simple methods cannot detect structured text accurately, leading to over-inpainting or missed regions.
- **Binary Mask Creation**: Simple thresholding or manual mask generation fails for text with varying fonts, sizes, or rotations.
- **Structural Preservation**: Basic inpainting does not account for the highly structured and patterned nature of satellite images or maps, often resulting in blurry or unrealistic outputs.

For instance:
- Labels over roads, rivers, or dense cityscapes disrupt patterns.
- Simple inpainting introduces artifacts that ruin the contextual information in these critical areas.

## Our Solution
We designed a pipeline that integrates **Keras-OCR for text detection** with **LaMa inpainting** to ensure robust removal of text annotations from satellite and map images while preserving the structural and visual integrity of the surrounding content.

### Key Steps in the Pipeline
1. **Text Detection**:
   - Use Keras-OCR to detect text regions in the input image.
   - The bounding boxes of detected text are used to create a **binary mask**, where text regions are marked in white, and the rest is black.

2. **Binary Mask Creation**:
   - The mask accurately highlights the regions requiring inpainting without including unnecessary artifacts or missing any critical text.

3. **LaMa Inpainting**:
   - Using the binary mask, the LaMa model inpaints the detected regions, ensuring seamless blending with the surrounding environment.  
   - It effectively handles structured and textured regions like roads, rivers, or buildings.

### Process Workflow
1. **Input**:
   - Satellite or map images in a directory (`input`).
2. **Intermediate Step**:
   - A binary mask is created, highlighting text areas.
3. **Output**:
   - Final inpainted images are saved in the specified output directory (`output`).

# Text Removal and Inpainting for Satellite/Map Images

## Problem Statement
Satellite images and map visuals often contain annotations, labels, and text that obstruct important underlying details. For tasks such as geographical analysis, urban planning, or automated map processing, removing this text while preserving the structural integrity of the image is crucial.

### Challenges with Traditional Inpainting
Basic inpainting methods struggle with satellite or map images because:
1. **Text Detection**: Simple methods often fail to detect and isolate text in complex images.
2. **Binary Masks**: Manually creating masks for irregular or rotated text is inefficient and error-prone.
3. **Structured Backgrounds**: Satellite images and maps often have repeating patterns (e.g., roads, rivers, fields) that require precise reconstruction, which naive inpainting cannot achieve.

## Solution Overview
We implemented a two-step pipeline:
1. **Text Detection**: Using **Keras-OCR**, we detect text in the image and generate binary masks.
2. **Inpainting**: Using **LaMa**, we inpaint the detected text regions to produce a clean, seamless image.

## Binary Mask Approaches
Two approaches were used for generating the binary mask, each producing different results:

### **1. Segmented Text Mask**
- The binary mask contains **only the text itself** as white pixels, while the rest of the image is black.
- When passed to the LaMa inpainting model, this approach produced **partially cleaned results**, leaving traces of text in some cases.

#### Example
- **Input Image**:  
  *Insert image of satellite/map with text annotations here.*  
- **Binary Mask**:  
  *Insert binary mask with segmented text here.*  
- **Inpainted Result**:  
  *Insert partially cleaned result image here.*  

---

### **2. Full Rectangle Mask**
- The binary mask highlights the **entire bounding rectangle** around the text in white, with the rest of the image as black.
- This approach gave **superior results**, as the LaMa model could completely remove the text and reconstruct the surrounding area effectively.

#### Example
- **Input Image**:  
  *Insert image of satellite/map with text annotations here.*  
- **Binary Mask**:  
  *Insert binary mask with bounding rectangles here.*  
- **Inpainted Result**:  
  *Insert fully cleaned result image here.*  

---

## Final Workflow

1. **Input Directory**: Provide a directory of images containing text annotations.
2. **Text Detection**: Detect text regions using Keras-OCR.
3. **Binary Mask Creation**: Generate a binary mask using the **full rectangle mask approach**.
4. **Inpainting**: Use LaMa to inpaint the masked regions.
5. **Output Directory**: Save the inpainted images to the specified directory.
